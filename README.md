Building the code
-----------------

1. Install the latest [Xcode developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple.
1. Install, [Brew](https://brew.sh), Node, and a Python3 virtualenv for localization scripts:
    ```shell
    brew update
    brew install node
    pip3 install virtualenv
    ```
1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios
    ```
1. Install Node.js dependencies, build user scripts and update content blocker:
    ```shell
    cd firefox-ios
    sh ./bootstrap.sh
    ```
1. Open the `Client.xcodeproj` under the `firefox-ios` folder in Xcode.
1. Make sure to select the `Fennec` [scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/build-system?changes=_2) in Xcode.
1. Select the destination device you want to build on.
1. Run the app with `Cmd + R` or by pressing the `build and run` button.

⚠️ Important: In case you have dependencies issues with SPM, please try the following:
- Xcode -> File -> Packages -> Reset Package Caches

Building User Scripts
-----------------

User Scripts (JavaScript injected into the `WKWebView`) are compiled, concatenated, and minified using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). User Scripts to be aggregated are placed in the following directories:

```none
/Client
|-- /Frontend
    |-- /UserContent
        |-- /UserScripts
            |-- /AllFrames
            |   |-- /AtDocumentEnd
            |   |-- /AtDocumentStart
            |-- /MainFrame
                |-- /AtDocumentEnd
                |-- /AtDocumentStart
```

This reduces the total possible number of User Scripts down to four. The compiled output from concatenating and minifying the User Scripts placed in these folders resides in `/Client/Assets` and are named accordingly:

* `AllFramesAtDocumentEnd.js`
* `AllFramesAtDocumentStart.js`
* `MainFrameAtDocumentEnd.js`
* `MainFrameAtDocumentStart.js`

To simplify the build process, these compiled files are checked-in to this repository. When adding or editing User Scripts, these files can be re-compiled with `webpack` manually. This requires Node.js to be installed, and all required `npm` packages can be installed by running `npm install` in the project's root directory. User Scripts can be compiled by running the following `npm` command in the root directory of the project:

```shell
npm run build
```
